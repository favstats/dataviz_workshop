Welcome to this workshop for data visualization in R. This is an
interactive tutorial build with `learnr`. You can run the code provided
in this tutorial yourself and play around with the data to your heart’s
content.

This workshop is broadly based on the [*Exploratory Data
Analysis*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)
chapter of the *R for Data Science* book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett
Grolemund (the book is publically accessible
[here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)).
